I used two methods of R, igraph and networkD3, to implement the project.
Link: https://github.com/13020363/UTS_ML2019_ID13020363/tree/DVVA/DVVA/A3
In this directory, these files belong to three parts:

Dataset:
email.csv - edges information
emailnodes.csv - nodes information

Igraph:
A3 with names.png - the result
A3.R - the commands used to implement this way

NetworkD3:
NetworkD3.html - the result
A3_NetworkD3.R - the commands used to implement this way

PS: Because the scripts contain the dir of dataset, you'd better change the dir to your local dir if running the scripts.
