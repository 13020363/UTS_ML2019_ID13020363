I used two methods of R, igraph and networkD3, to implement the project.

In this directory, these files belongs to three parts:

Dataset:
email.csv - edges information
emailnodes.csv - nodes information

Igraph:
A3.png - the result
A3.R - the commands used to implemant this way

NetworkD3:
NetworkD3.html - the result
A3_NetworkD3.R - the commands used to implemant this way
